# Extension Pack HP

The Extension Pack HP is a custom library for HP calculators (HP 50g, HP 49g, and HP 49g+) written in UserRPL. It enhances the system by adding financial tools (like NPV and IRR calculators), custom menus for mathematical operations, system utilities (such as factory resets and file purging), and user interface extensions that integrate seamlessly into the built-in application menus.
